# lua_machine_learning

###### Project by weekOldRoadkill

---




## Dependencies

- [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/) / [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)

---




## Running


With LuaJIT:

```sh
luajit machine_learning
```


With Lua:

```sh
lua machine_learning
```


There's also a shebang to run it with luajit like so:

```sh
./machine_learning
```


On Windows I recommend running this through [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), but it can
probably work through Windows' Command shell or PowerShell.

## Notes

Developed and tested on x86_64 Arch Linux with the `luajit` and `lua` packages from the
official Arch repos, and with the `luajit-2.1-git` package from the AUR.
